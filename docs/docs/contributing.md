# Contributor Guidelines

## Submitting Changes to Chronos

- A GitHub pull request is the preferred way of submitting patch sets.

- Any changes in the public API or behavior must be reflected in the project
  documentation.

- Pull requests should include appropriate additions to the unit test suite.

- If the change is a bugfix, then the added tests must fail without the patch
  as a safeguard against future regressions.

## Contributing Documentation

We heartily welcome contributions to Chronos's documentation. Documentation should be submitted as a pull request againstthe `master` branch and published to our GitHub pages site by a Chronos committer using the instructions in [docs/README.md](https://github.com/mesos/chronos/tree/master/docs).
