# Configuration

Starting with Chronos 2.0, Chronos uses the [Chaos Framework](https://github.com/mesosphere/chaos), a minimal Jetty, Guice, Jersey & Jackson library, that also handles command line arguments - which in turn uses [Scallop](https://github.com/scallop/scallop).

To get a full list of options, use start-chronos.bash --help.
